I'm a software architect and instructor who loves building scalable systems and sharing knowledge.
I specialize in designing clean, maintainable architectures for enterprise applications using .NET, Java, Angular, and modern DevOps tools.

For the last few years, I’ve been actively involved in:

🚀 Designing microservices-based ERP and CRM systems

🎓 Delivering corporate training to engineers at companies like Turkcell, Bosch, Borusan, TKİ, and EGM

🛠 Creating code generators, educational content, and developer tools

💬 Teaching clean code, DDD, CQRS, SOLID, and system design with real-world examples

I believe in teaching by doing — and I love seeing others grow through practical examples and real projects.

Let’s connect and build something awesome!
